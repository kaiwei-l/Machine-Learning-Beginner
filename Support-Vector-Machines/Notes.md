### Separate data with the maximum margin
* Linear Separable
  * There are two groups of data, and the data points are separated enough that you could draw a straight line on the figure with all the points of one class on one side and all the points of the other class on the other side of the line.

* Hyperplane
  * The hyperplane is our decision boundary, i.e. everything on one side is one class and everything on the other side belongs to a different class

* Margin
  * We would like to find the point cloest to the separating hyperplane and make sure this is as far away from the separating line as possible. Note that we want to find the greatest possible margin.

* Support Vector
  * The points cloest to the separating hyperplane are known as support vector
