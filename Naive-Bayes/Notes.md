### Bayesian decision theory

* In a nutshell, it means choosing the decision with the highest probability
* If p1(x, y) > p2(x, y), then the class is 1
* If p2(x, y) > p1(x, y), then the class is 2

### Bayes' rule (To manipulate conditional probabilities)

* p(c|x) = [p(x|c) * p(c)] / p(x)

```python
a = 3
b = 2
if a == b:
  print(True)
```
